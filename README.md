# saintTorrent

A beautiful, high-performance BitTorrent client for the terminal, written in Go. saintTorrent utilizes [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) to deliver a gorgeous and feature-rich Terminal User Interface (TUI).

## Features

- ⚙️ **Torrent Management:** Add torrents via local `.torrent` file paths or magnet URIs.
- 📊 **Real-time Statistics:** Track download/upload speeds, percent completion, connected peers, and session statistics.
- 🗺️ **Visual Piece Map:** A live, retro piece-map visualizer showing which pieces are completed, downloading, or pending.
- 📂 **Interactive File Explorer:** Browse files inside multi-file torrents and set custom file-level priorities.
- 📶 **DHT Support:** Bootstraps peer discovery via Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) if trackers are unavailable.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24 or later installed on your system.

### Build from Source
Clone the repository and build the binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/david-saint/saint-torrent.git
cd saint-torrent
go build -o sainttorrent ./cmd/sainttorrent
```

---

## Usage

Start the client with default download directory (`.`):

```bash
./sainttorrent
```

Specify a custom download directory:

```bash
./sainttorrent -d /path/to/downloads
```

Start the client and automatically queue a torrent or magnet link:

```bash
./sainttorrent -d /path/to/downloads "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..."
# or using a local file:
./sainttorrent -d /path/to/downloads my_awesome_file.torrent
```

### macOS Magnet Handler

On macOS you can register saintTorrent as the default handler for `magnet:`
links:

```bash
./register_magnet.sh
```

This builds the CLI, installs a small launcher app to
`~/Applications/saintTorrent.app`, and sets it as the `magnet:` handler. When a
magnet link is opened, the launcher hands it to a running saintTorrent instance
over its IPC socket; if none is running, it opens a terminal and starts one.

#### Choosing your terminal

The terminal used for that fallback is configurable. Edit
`~/.config/sainttorrent/config.json` (created on first registration) and set
`terminalApp`:

```json
{
  "terminalApp": "iTerm"
}
```

- **`Terminal`** (default) and **`iTerm`** get first-class support and are
  driven directly via AppleScript.
- Any other value (e.g. `Ghostty`, `kitty`) is launched generically by opening
  a temporary `.command` script with that app. This only runs the command in
  terminals registered to open `.command` files; apps that ignore document-open
  arguments may launch without starting the CLI.

This file is **not** overwritten when you re-run `register_magnet.sh`, so your
choice persists across upgrades.
